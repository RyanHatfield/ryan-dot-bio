Welcome to my new website! I've been a web developer for years, and always thought I needed some sort of complicated website structure to show off my dynamic and sometimes forward thinking skills. I decided that reverting to sipmlicity can be a great way to show my general mantra: Work smarter not harder.

I created this static website with Jekyll, so check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
